React uses the javascript library to create efficient user interfaces of web applications in an effective way. It helps us to compose small pieces of code from complex UIs. It’ll update the right component when data changes and allow us to create fast and simple web applications.

First of all, you’ve to install “NodeJs”. If you don’t have “NodeJs” in your local machine then you should install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download). You’ve to install the LTS Version of NodeJs according to the bit of your computer.

Now we are going to create react app…

> \*First command: “\**npx create-react-app first **-app**”*

It will take some time to install.

If you’ve previously installed “***create-react-app***” globally via “***npm install -g create-react-app***”, we recommend you uninstall the package using “***npm uninstall -g create-react-app***” to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.  


[*“**npx***](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b)*” is a package runner tool that comes with np*m 5.2+ and higher. It is easier to work with updated versions for being \*competitive with browser and vs code.

“***create-react-app***” is the command to build the react app.

“***first-app***” is the command we where we’ve to be careful. This will be our app name so we’ve to choose a meaningful name here. Here we’ve used the “***first-app***” name to create our react app. Every time we want to create a react app we’ve to choose a name that is something related to our work that can express our goal.

Here we can see in the terminal window that npx is downloading the necessary data to run react app.
