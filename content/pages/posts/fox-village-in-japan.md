React uses the javascript library to create efficient user interfaces of web applications in an effective way. It helps us to compose small pieces of code from complex UIs. It’ll update the right component when data changes and allow us to create fast and simple web applications.






First of all, you’ve to install “NodeJs”. If you don’t have “NodeJs” in your local machine then you should install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download). You’ve to install the LTS Version of NodeJs according to the bit of your computer.

Now we are going to create react app…

F*irst command: “**npx create-react-app first*****-app***”*



                                 ![](https://preview--nazmus-simple-blog-14b6f.stackbit.dev/\_static/app-assets/images/1\_cJrTgmUdEdJAlvaESYnFuA.png)

It will take some time to install.



If you’ve previously installed “***create-react-app***” globally via “***npm install -g create-react-app***”, we recommend you uninstall the package using “***npm uninstall -g create-react-app***” to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

[*“**npx***](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b)*” is a package runner tool that comes with np*m 5.2+ an*d higher. It is easier to work with updated versions for being *competitive with browser and vs code.

“***create-react-app***” is the command to build the react app.

“***first-app***” is the command we where we’ve to be careful. This will be our app name so we’ve to choose a meaningful name here. Here we’ve used the “***first-app***” name to create our react app. Every time we want to create a react app we’ve to choose a name that is something related to our work that can express our goal.

                                      ![](/images/2-da3c4231.png)

Here we can see in the terminal window that npx is downloading the necessary data to run react app.

                                      ![](/images/3.png)

Here we can see react app installation complete message in terminal window.

After installation it will create a directory called “***first-app***” inside the current folder of your desired location.
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install all the transitive dependencies.



Here we can see no configuration or complicated folder structures is there, just only the files you will need to build your app.
Now, you can open your directory as the installation is done.

                                   ![](/images/4.png)

Here *node_modules* is full with many folders made by react developers. There are many webpack and babel preconfigured and hidden in ![](/images/5.png)here. So you don't have to focus on this folder. As a beginner, you just ignore the folder and don't touch it.
